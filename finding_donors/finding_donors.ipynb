    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **Decision Trees** : <br>\n",
    "Decision trees can be used in application recommendation systems for application stores such as the Google Play Store. <br>Decision trees are great where we need straightforward inferences from our data, as results can be interpreted as conditional statements on features (such as - if a user is a male student under 15, recommend the app Pokemon Go). These simple interpretations allow us to make more general claims about the data.<br>The weakness of this model is that it has a tendency to overfit. For instance, a decision tree with a large depth (such as 5) probably overfits, because it places many conditions on the features to the point where the model is simply memorizing boundaries in the data. Furthermore, models trained on datasets with large number of features show a greater tendency to overfit (greater variance), which is problematic for us since our data distribution has 103 features. <br>This model is a good candidate because the many features in the data appear as though conditionals can create suitable splits in the data (such as workclass, education level, occupation etc.) For instance, a person with a bachelor's degree should earn much better than a person with an 11th grade education. <br>\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: <br> The random forest algorithm can be used where the data consists of a set of features that can be split well using conditionals and the number of features is large; for instance, this algorithm can be used to predict potential customer interest in an expensive product (such as a car) based on their information. <br> The strength of this model is that it rarely overfits and generally provides a good accuracy. <br> The weakness is that it is a black box model, thus we lose the straightforward inferential power that decision trees give us. That is, we cannot formulate straightforward conditional interpretations of the results of our model, even if the features in the data seem suitable for the same. Furthermore, random forests are bad predictors on small amounts of data (small number of features), and also fail when the data contains many features that are not informative about the output variable. Random forests are also biased towards continous features (therefore there is a source of bias in the model). <br>This model is a good candidate as it capitalizes on the advantages of decision trees without bearing any of their shortcomings. That is, the model utilizes conditionals to create splits in the data, but it does not overfit as a small number of features is randomly selected, repeatedly. <br>  \n",
    "- **Support Vector Machines** : <br>SVMs are good general purpose classifiers/regressors. They perform slowly on large datasets, therefore are best used on smaller ones. Very high precision can be achieved using SVMs by using an appropriate kernel and tweaking its hyperparameters. Thus they can find use in medical classifiers, such as a classifier to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on patient records. <br>SVMs achieve satisying results in most cases, and work best on smaller datasets. <br>SVMs do suffer from a tendency to overfit if the hyperparameters are given large values. They can become very slow on large datasets (having many features, especially when number of features far exceeds number of data points). Furthermore other algorithms such as the perceptron algorithm in neural networks achieves better results as model and also performs faster when used on large datasets. <br>SVMs are good candidates for this problem as the number of data points is very large compared to the number of features. However, such a large dataset means that SVMs will likely perform slowly. "

    "However, the random forest classifier outperforms the decision tree on the testing set f-score. Furthermore, the accuracy scores of the decision tree classifier indicate overfitting. In addition, the SVM seems to obtain very close testing and training scores overall, which is good since this indicates low variance in this model. However the values are also small, which indicates high bias and means that the SVM model is overfitting. For this reason, the decision tree and the SVM classifiers have not been chosen. <br>When the training/prediction times of the models are factored in, the support vector machine classifier heavily loses, especially on the 100% dataset training/prediction times. The random forest classifier does marginally worse than the decision tree classifier, but the difference is too small to be of any importance. Thus the random forest classifier wins out here too. <br>As discussed earlier, the decision tree and random forest classifiers seem suitable for the data as it consists of many categorical variables that can be nicely split using conditionals; further out of the two random forest classifiers handle large datasets better than decision trees as the latter have a tendency to overfit. Thus the random forest classifier seems to be the best choice out of all three classifiers."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The random forest classifier is an ensemble method that works by taking votes from simpler decision tree classifiers, so it makes sense to describe decision trees first. Decision trees are classifiers that classify data points based on simple conditions placed on the qualities of those data points. For instance, take a dataset of cars having the following two features: brand and colour. Brand can be Ferrari or Toyota, and colour can be 'Red' or 'White'. We then train our decision tree classifier to predict whether a car is red or white based on the maker of the car. From real life experience, we know that a Toyota is likelier to be white and that a Ferrari is likelier to be red. So the decision tree will probably make the following split: if the car is a Toyota, predict white; if its a Ferrari, predict red. Of course, this model makes many mistakes but given the data, this is probably the best generalized prediction we can make. <br>Now we consider the case when there are many relevant features that predict something. In this case, the decision tree classifier tends to memorize the patterns in the data. This is bad because the model will almost certainly perform bad on unseen data, because it memorized what it has seen rather than understanding it. This is where random forests can help. In random forests, we create multiple decision trees, each randomly selecting only some of the features in the dataset and training on them. This way, each decision tree makes different predictions based on what it has learned. Then, we take a vote from each decision tree whenever we try to make predictions on unseen data, and the majority vote decides our final prediction."

    "These features are mostly similiar to the ones I had predicted. For instance, I predicted that education would be an important factor, however education_num appears to be more important than education_level. The reasoning for both is similar, but with a subtle difference: both indicate the level of professional qualification of the person in question; however the education-level metric is more important to jobs better jobs where the education-num is standardized according to the education-level (2 years for a Master's degree etc), while the education-num is more important to jobs where level of education (and therefore qualification) is highly dependent on the years of education, such as jobs that hire high-schoolers and high-school graduates (a 12th grader would be more qualified than a 10th grader etc). Hours-per-week being an important metric indicates that the dataset (and perhaps even our initial problem) mostly deals with people with lower income jobs, where the income varies according to the hours spent at work.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The metrics indicate that the model performs worse when trained on the reduced data. If training time was a factor, I would still prefer to train the random forest model on the full dataset rather than just a part of it, because the difference is not large. However, given much larger datasets, or given a different model (such as an SVM), it might make more sense to train on reduced data rather than using the full data. "
